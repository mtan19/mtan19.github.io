            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                Kerbal Space Program (KSP) is a game in which players assemble rockets 
                by combining various rocket parts, such as rocket engines, fuel tanks, 
                payload fairings, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Parameters such as the rocket’s cost and capabilities are dependent on 
                the types of parts used, their number of parts used, and their arrangement 
                within the rocket. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of this excel sheet was to calculate the actual launch costs of 
                various rocket designs, and allow for comparing the cost effectiveness of rocket 
                designs.

            <h1>Game Mechanics</h1>
            <h2>Rocket part recovery</h2>
            <p>
                Within KSP, there is a game mechanic that allows for rockets to have flown to be 
                recovered, allowing for a partial refund of the cost of the rocket.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, not all rocket parts can be recovered. Any rocket part that is destroyed, 
                despawns (by exiting the range in which in-game physics are calculated), or is unable 
                to return to the surface of Kerbin (the planet) becomes unrecoverable. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Examples of unrecoverable parts of a rocket include
                <ul>
                    <li>Rocket stages that are jettisoned at a low altitude and do not make it into orbit</li>
                    <li>Any fuel burnt</li>
                    <li>Any stages that are unable to de-orbit and come back to the surface of Kerbin (the planet)</li>
                    <li>Any rocket parts that are destroyed during descent or landing on Kerbin (typically 
                        caused by the part crashing onto the surface too hard)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Any parts that are not destroyed or despawned, and returns safely to the surface of 
                Kerbin can be recovered for a partial refund of the part cost. The recovered cost is 
                multiplied by the recovery rate, which is determined by the distance in which the part 
                is recovered from the launch site.
                <div Class="paragraphIndent">
                    <p>
                        The recovery rate is determined by the formula<br>
                        0.98 - surface_distance_in_km/2150
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The recovery rate ranges from a 10.32% minimum to a 100% maximum
                    </p>

            </p>
            <h2>Launch Cost Equation</h2>
            <p>
                Based on these game mechanics, the launch cost of a given rocket can be expressed 
                as a linear equation<br>
                <div Class="paragraphIndent">
                    <p>
                        LaunchCost = UnrecoverableCost + LossesFromImperfectRecovery<br>
                        LaunchCost = UnrecoverableCost + (1-RecoveryRate)*RecoverableCost
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As<br>
                        TotalCost = UnrecoverableCost + RecoverableCost<br>
                        UnrecoverableCost = TotalCost - RecoverableCost
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is possible to manipulate the equation to<br>
                        LaunchCost = (TotalCost - RecoverableCost) + (1-RecoveryRate)*RecoverableCost<br>
                        <b>LaunchCost = TotalCost - RecoverableCost*RecoveryRate</b>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </p>
            <p>
                The equation in the form of <br>
                LaunchCost = TotalCost - RecoverableCost*RecoveryRate <br>
                is better suited for the game, as the total cost is given in-game, thus 
                only the RecoveryCost needs to be determined by removing parts and emptying tanks
                <div Class="paragraphIndent">
                    <!--DIAGRAM?-->

            </p>
            <p>
                Cost comparisons between rocket designs can be done by calculating the intersections of 
                the two linear equations. The intersection provides the RecoveryRate in which the rocket 
                designs have equal launch costs. <br>
                <b>Intersection RecoveryRate = (TotalCost1-TotalCost2)/(RecoverableCost1-RecoverableCost2)</b>
                <div class="paragraphIndent">
                    <p>Note: The formula typically used to calculate the intersection of two linear 
                        equations in the form of y=ax+b is<br>
                        x=(b1-b2)/(a2-a1)<br>
                        Where a2 is subtracted by a1 in the denominator
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the purposes of this comparison, a = -RecoverableCost. Simplifying the equation 
                        to use RecoverableCost (positive) instead of -RecoverableCost (negative),<br>
                        x=(b1-b2)/((-RecoverableCost2)-(-RecoverableCost1))<br>
                        x=(b1-b2)/(-RecoverableCost2+RecoverableCost1)<br>
                        x=(b1-b2)/(RecoverableCost1-RecoverableCost2)<br>
                        And thus, RecoverableCost1 is subtracted by RecoverableCost2, which is the reverse of 
                        the typical equation.

                RecoveryRates were calculated for every 10% increment, along with 3 additional values
                <ul>
                    <li>98% - the RecoveryRate when a part lands within an approximately 25 km² 
                        area surrounding Kerbal Space Center. </li>
                    <li>54.16% - the RecoveryRate when travelling a quarter orbit around Kerbin</li>
                    <li>10.32% - the RecoveryRate when travelling a half orbit around Kerbin, directly 
                        opposite Kerbin from the Kerbal Space Center, and is the furthest possible 
                        distance from the launch site.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The list of costs was calculated using the expression<br>
                LaunchCost = TotalCost - RecoverableCost*RecoveryRate<br>

            <h2>Cost Comparisons</h2>

                The cost comparisons between rocket designs is calculated on the

                The names of each rocket design is automatically duplicated from the

            </p>
            <p>
                The comparison function was implemented to compare the costs of each rocket, but 
                this produced issues that required addressing
                <div Class="paragraphIndent">
                    <p>
                        Issue 1: The intersection of the two linear equations falls beyond the range 
                        of 0 and 1 (inclusive). Since it is not possible to have a RecoveryRate of 
                        less than 0% (a complete loss) or greater than 100% (a complete recovery), 
                        the intersection does not provide meaningful information. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Issue 2: The rockets have equal RecoverableCost. This causes the linear 
                        equations to be parallel, and thus having no intersection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under the circumstances outlined in Issue 1 and Issue 2, the cost comparison can 
                        be done by simply comparing the TotalCost of the rockets. Since the linear 
                        equations do not intersect within the range of 0 and 1 (between a 0% and 100% 
                        RecoveryRate), the rocket with the lower TotalCost will always be cheaper within the 
                        useful range.
                        <!--INCLUDE VISUALS USING DESMOS?-->
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Issue 3: For linear equations that do intersect within the range of 0 and 1, the 
                        value of the intersection alone does not provide useful information. Along with knowing 
                        the intersection, it is necessary to determine which rocket design is cheaper for a 
                        given RecoveryRate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This again can be achieved by comparing the TotalCosts of the rockets. The rocket with the 
                        lower TotalCost will be cheaper from 0% to the intersection RecoveryRate, and the rocket 
                        with the higher TotalCost will be cheaper from the intersection RecoveryRate till 100%.

                The Expression included the fixes to the issues, and was implemented with the following logic
                <div Class="paragraphIndent">

                The Class 151-auto rocket was a next-generation rocket designed to 
                carry heavier payloads to orbit using the newly unlocked RE-I5 "Skipper" 
                rocket engine. <br>

            <p>
                However, a new contract to test LFB KR1x2 "Twin Boar" rocket engine allowed 
                for temporary use of the engine, and a X152 prototype rocket using the new 
                engine was built. The performance of the X152 was tested to be comparable 
                with Class 151-auto.<br>
                PICTURE X152
            </p>
            <p>
                The TotalCost of the X152 was more expensive than the Class 151-auto, but the 
                X152 had a higher RecoverableCost. This was a product of the X152 having less 
                unrecoverable parts, notably the lack of solid rocket boosters that would be 
                jettisoned (and thus be unrecoverable) in the early stages of the launch. There 
                was a possibility that the X152 could prove to be the cheaper launch vehicle.
            </p>
            <p>
                The launch costs of the two rockets were studied using the tool. <br>

                <img src="images/KSC_RocketCalc_RocketCost_Example_CostComaprison.png" alt="Comparing costs of 151-auto and X152">
            </p>
            <p>
                After analysis, while it was true that the X152 could have cheaper launch costs 
                than the Class 151-auto, that would only be true if the X152 could be recovered 
                at a RecoveryRate greater than about 86%. This would mean that the rocket would 
                need to land and be recovered at a location closer than 241 km from the Launch 
                site. Although this would allow for a non-trivial area to land within, controlling 
                the descent to land within the area would require careful calculation and skill.
            </p>
            <p>
                This narrow scope in which the X152 would be cheaper was due to its expensive 
                TotalCost. Despite having more recoverable parts, the total costs of the 
                recoverable parts was close to the TotalCost of the Class 151-auto, meaning that 
                any benefit could not be realized unless most of the cost could be recovered with 
                a high RecoveryRate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, the maximum possible benefit the X152 could provide over the Class 
                151-auto was only a cost of 1563. Considering that a single AV-R8 Winglet (attached 
                at the bottom of the rocket) costs 640, which had the possibility of getting destroyed 
                in a bad landing, the benefits were meagre and could easily be lost.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on this analysis, it was decided to not pursue further development of the X152. 
                The testing was done with a temporary unlocking of the  LFB KR1x2 "Twin Boar" rocket 
                engine. Unlocking the part would have required [UNLOCK SCIENCE AND FUNDS], which 
                simply could not justify its limited benefits.
